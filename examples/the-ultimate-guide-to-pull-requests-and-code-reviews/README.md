- **Verify Bug Fixes:** Test changes in a live environment if possible.
- **Use Templates:** Ensure all necessary information is consistently included.

## Pull Request Templates

Most Git hosting platforms, such as GitHub, support pull request templates. Pull request templates help standardize the information provided in a PR, making it easier for reviewers to understand the changes and context.

Using pull request templates ensures that all necessary information is provided consistently.

For example, on GitHub, you can create a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` file in the `.github` directory of your repository. This template can include sections for description, type of change, testing instructions, checklist, etc.

**Example Pull Request Template:**

```markdown
## Description

Please include a summary of the changes and the related issue. List any dependencies that are required for this change.

Fixes # (issue)

## Type of Change

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update

## How Has This Been Tested?

Please describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce.

- [ ] Test A
- [ ] Test B

## Checklist:

- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines of this project
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings
- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged and published in downstream modules
- [ ] I have checked my code and corrected any misspellings
```

This template ensures that all PRs include essential information and follow the same structure.

In the section below, we provide a detailed guide on how to [automate PR validation using DangerJS and TypeScript](#example-automate-pr-validation-with-dangerjs-and-typescript).

You could also use templates to manage different aspects of the Issue and PR lifecycle. For example, you could have a template for bug reports, feature requests, and other types of issues. You can check out one complete example of how to manage this in the [Issues section of the DevOps Reference repository](https://github.com/nanlabs/devops-reference/issues/new/choose) where we have templates for different types of issues. You can also check out we made it possible in the [source of the issue templates](https://github.com/nanlabs/devops-reference/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).

## Review Workflow

- **Comprehend the Issue and Solution:** Ensure that the solution aligns with the identified issue to solve.
- **Keep Reviews Short:** Limit reviews to 1 hour to maintain quality.
- **Focus on Manageable Sections:** Review 200-400 lines of code at a time for efficiency.
- **Give Clear, Actionable Feedback:** Use examples to clarify suggestions.
- **Test new Features and Bug Fixes:** Verify changes in a live environment when possible.

## Communication and Precision

- **Be Explicit in Requests:** Clearly specify the scope and expectations for the review.
- **Utilize a PR Template:** Ensure all necessary information is included.
- **Foster Constructive Dialogue:** Maintain open, respectful communication.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Requester

- **Clear Communication:** Clearly specify lines and corrections needed.

## Example: Automate PR Validation with DangerJS and TypeScript

<details>
  <summary>Automate PR Validation with DangerJS and TypeScript</summary>

To streamline the initial validation of Pull Requests and save valuable time, you can use DangerJS with TypeScript. This setup helps automate checks, enforce coding standards, and ensure that all required information is included in the PR description.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install DangerJS and TypeScript:**

   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev danger typescript
   ```

2. **Initialize a TypeScript configuration:**

   ```sh
   npx tsc --init
   ```

3. **Create a Dangerfile:**
   Create a `dangerfile.ts` in the root of your project with the following content:

   ```typescript
   import { danger, warn, fail, message } from "danger";

   // Check for a summary in the description
   if (danger.github.pr.body.length === 0) {
     fail("Please provide a description for your PR.");
   }

   // Check for linked issues
   const issueRegex = /#[0-9]+/;
   if (!issueRegex.test(danger.github.pr.body)) {
     warn("Please link an issue in the description.");
   }

   // Check for a checklist
   const checklistRegex = /## Checklist:/;
   if (!checklistRegex.test(danger.github.pr.body)) {
     warn("Please include a checklist in the PR description.");
   }

   // Example of a custom rule
   if (danger.github.pr.additions + danger.github.pr.deletions > 500) {
     warn("This PR is quite large, consider splitting it into smaller PRs.");
   }
   ```

4. **Add Danger to your CI pipeline:**

   Update your CI configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run Danger on each PR:

   ```yaml
   name: Pull Request Validation

    concurrency:
      group: pull_request_${{ github.event.number }}
      cancel-in-progress: true

    on:
      pull_request:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      pr-review:
        name: Danger JS

        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.draft == false

        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        permissions:
          actions: write
          checks: write
          contents: write
          issues: write
          pull-requests: write
          statuses: write

        steps:
          - name: Begin CI...
            uses: actions/checkout@v4

          - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
            with:
              node-version: "v22"

          - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm install

          - name: Danger JS Action
            uses: danger/danger-js@9.1.8
            env:
              GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

5. **Run Danger:**

   Ensure Danger runs on every PR to automate initial checks and validations.

This setup will help enforce standards and save time by automating the initial validation process for PRs.
