# Cognito Local Development with Docker Compose and Serverless

This repository provides a local development environment for Cognito using [cognito-local](https://github.com/jagregory/cognito-local) and the serverless framework for managing lambda trigger functions.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following software installed on your local development machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**Note: Node.js 16.13.2 or later is required on your local development machine, but not on the server. You can use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.**

To switch to the required Node.js version, run the following command:

```sh
fnm use
```

## Quickstart

Follow these steps to quickly get started with the Cognito local development environment:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nanlabs/devops-reference.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Cognito local example directory:

   ```sh
   cd devops-reference/examples/serverless-cognito-local
   ```

3. Start the required services using Docker Compose:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

The following services will be started:

- `cognito-local` at [http://localhost:9229](http://localhost:9229)
- `setup-resources`: a service for creating the user pool and user pool client

### Preconfigured Resources

Running `docker-compose up` will automatically create the following resources:

1. User pool located at `./.cognito/db/local_XXXXXX.json`
2. User pool client located at `./.cognito/db/clients.json`

### Important Notes

- The `setup-resources` service will create a user pool and a user pool client on the first run. If you want to reset the user pool, you can delete the `./.cognito/db/local_XXXXXX.json` file and restart the service.
- If you only want to run the `cognito-local` service, you can use the command `docker-compose up cognito-local`.
- If you are using a JWT validation library like [aws-jwt-verify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-jwt-verify), make sure to change the user pool ID from `local_XXXXXX` to a matching ID from a user pool created in your AWS account.
You will also need to add the following code to your `./.cognito/config.json` file:

```json
"TokenConfig": {
"IssuerDomain": "https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com"
}
```

Replace {region} with the appropriate AWS region where your Cognito user pool is located. For example, if your user pool is in the us-west-2 region, the updated configuration would be:

```json
"TokenConfig": {
"IssuerDomain": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
}
```
