### üåü Continuous Integration Workflow Guide üåü

## Overview

üîç This guide aims to provide tools that allow us to detect potential vulnerabilities in our projects within a CI/CD workflow. By integrating security checks early and throughout the development process, you can ensure your projects are robust and secure.

---

## Github Actions üöÄ

### Snyk üîí

Snyk offers various actions on Github, which can be directly utilized from the Github Marketplace ([Snyk Github Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/snyk)) or by referring to the official Snyk documentation ([Snyk Official Documentation](https://github.com/snyk/actions)).

#### Prerequisites üìù

To use these actions, the first step is to obtain your `SNYK_TOKEN`. For this purpose, follow these steps:

1. **In the Snyk UI:**
   - Go to your Snyk account's settings page ([Snyk Account Settings](https://app.snyk.io/account)) and retrieve the API token.
   - Reference: [Revoking and Regenerating Snyk API Tokens](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004008278-Revoking-and-regenerating-Snyk-API-tokens).

2. **Using the Snyk CLI:**
   - Run `snyk config get api` to retrieve the token ([Snyk CLI Documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/getting-started-with-the-cli)).

### Examples üí°

Once you have your `SNYK_TOKEN`, you can start using the actions. Below is a basic example for a Node.js application:

```yaml
name: Example workflow using Snyk
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

üì∏ By integrating this `YAML` file into your project, the following actions will be executed:

![Snyk CI/CD Example](../assets/snyk-cicd-example.png)
![Snyk CI/CD Vulnerabilities](../assets/snyk-cicd-check-vulnerabilites.png)

> **Note:** This example was executed on a React app created with Vite.

#### Monitor for New Vulnerabilities üïµÔ∏è

To monitor for new vulnerabilities, use the following configuration:

```yaml
name: Example workflow using Snyk
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
        with:
          command: monitor
```

#### High Severity Vulnerabilities Only üî¥

Use the `args` property to report only high-severity vulnerabilities:

```yaml
name: Example workflow using Snyk
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: --severity-threshold=high
```

#### Custom Development Environment üñ•Ô∏è

Use `snyk/actions/setup` to install only the Snyk CLI if you already have the development tools installed:

```yaml
name: Snyk example
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - uses: snyk/actions/setup@master
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v1
        with:
          go-version: '1.19'
      - name: Snyk test
        run: snyk test
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

#### Continuing on Error ‚ö†Ô∏è

To ensure the Action continues even if Snyk finds vulnerabilities, use `continue-on-error`:

```yaml
name: Example workflow using Snyk with continue on error
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        continue-on-error: true
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

#### GitHub Code Scanning Support üõ°Ô∏è

To use this option for private repositories, you must have GitHub Advanced Security. Use the `--sarif-file-output` option and upload Snyk scan results to GitHub Code Scanning:

```yaml
name: Example workflow using Snyk
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        continue-on-error: true
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: --sarif-file-output=snyk.sarif
      - name: Upload result to GitHub Code Scanning
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: snyk.sarif
```

#### CodeBuild Example üí°

Example of a `buildspec.yml` for a JavaScript project:

```yaml
version: 0.2
phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - npm install
artifacts:
  files:
    - "**/*"
```

#### Setup Steps üåü

1. **Add Stage**:
   - After the Source stage, add a Snyk scan stage. Click Edit, and Add a Scan Stage.

![AWS CodePipeline Step 1](../assets/aws-codepipeline-2.png)

2. **Add Action Group**:
   - Click Add an Action Group to open the Edit Action window:

![AWS CodePipeline Step 2](../assets/aws-codepipeline-3.png)

3. **Name the Action**:
   - Select Snyk as the Action Provider.
   - Click Connect with Snyk to begin the connection process.

![AWS CodePipeline Step 3](../assets/aws-codepipeline-4.png)

4. **Configure Settings**:
   - Configure the settings such as the Snyk organization where reports of findings are saved, vulnerability handling options, and monitoring behavior on build.

## Trivy üîç

Trivy is an open-source vulnerability scanner for container images, file systems, and Git repositories, suitable for continuous integration pipelines.

### Github Actions üöÄ

#### Setup Example

To use Trivy in your GitHub Actions workflow, add the following configuration to your workflow file:

```yaml
name: Trivy scan
on: push
jobs:
  trivy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Trivy
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          image-ref: 'aquasec/trivy:latest'
          scan-type: 'fs'
          severity: 'HIGH,CRITICAL'
```

#### Monitoring and Reporting

You can also configure Trivy to send reports and monitor for vulnerabilities:

```yaml
name: Trivy monitoring
on: schedule
  - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Run daily at midnight
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Trivy scan
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          scan-type: 'fs'
          severity: 'HIGH,CRITICAL'
          exit-code: '1'
```

### Gitlab CI/CD üîß

#### Integration Steps

1. **Add Trivy to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file**:

```yaml
stages:
  - security

trivy_scan:
  stage: security
  image: aquasec/trivy:latest
  script:
    - trivy fs --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .
```

2. **Configure Severity Levels**:
   - Ensure that only high-severity and critical vulnerabilities break the build.

### AWS CodePipeline üöÄ

#### Integration with AWS CodeBuild

1. **Add Trivy as a Build Step**:
   - Integrate Trivy into your buildspec file for AWS CodeBuild.

```yaml
version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 14
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - npm install
  build:
    commands:
      - npm run build
      - trivy fs --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL .
artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'
  discard-paths: no
```

### Alternative Tools üåê

- **Clair**: Static analysis tool for vulnerabilities in container images ([Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair)).
- **Anchore**: Tool for analyzing container images for security vulnerabilities ([Anchore](https://anchore.com/)).
